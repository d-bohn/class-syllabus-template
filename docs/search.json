    "text": "Course Description\nThe urgent challenge of climate change demands innovative solutions and comprehensive policy frameworks. This graduate-level course provides a systems approach to understanding the essential policy questions and analytic tools necessary to achieve the energy transition required to address climate change. Over the course of the semester, we will cover a broad range of topics, including an overview of the energy and climate landscape, project economics, energy sources and technologies, energy demand, environmental and health impacts, power system analysis, energy transition strategies, energy efficiency, sustainable consumption, climate justice, big data and AI for climate change, and the limitations of models. We will also explore emerging topics relevant to energy systems and achieving carbon neutrality. Through a combination of lectures, case studies, and real-world assignments, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of the essentials of energy and climate policy. We aim to provide students with a nuanced understanding of the energy transition landscape and prepare them to make a meaningful impact in shaping the policy frameworks that will drive the transition towards a sustainable future."
