## 1. What if Americans turned to small cars and electric vehicles?

In your first policy response, you were asked to discuss the impact and policy responses to America's big car problem. This assignment will give you a chance to practice with data and policy analysis. You will navigate through some common energy and carbon data, make some reasonable assumptions, and calculate some policy relevant metrics. 


### Questions

First, let's make some assumptions on the market penetration of small cars and electric vehicles. 

Key assumptions, all 2022 data:
- Average annual miles per vehicle: 11,000 miles^[https://afdc.energy.gov/data/10309]
- Averge subcompact small cars fuel efficiency: 33 mile per gallon (mpg); big cars pickup trucks: 20 mpg^[https://thundersaidenergy.com/downloads/us-vehicle-sales-by-fuel-economy-cars-trucks-and-suvs]
- Total registerd personal and commercial vehicles: 278,870,463^[https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/car-ownership-statistics]
- Big cars (large, crossover, SUVs) has a 65% of the market share^[https://www.autoinsurance.com/research/car-ownership-statistics/]


1. If U.S. replaces half of its big cars (large, crossover, SUVs) with small cars (subcompact, compact, and midsize cars) in 2022, how much oil US can save in one year? compare your result with U.S.'s daily oil imports. (1pt)

2. Now assume if U.S. replace all vehicles by EV by 2050. How much oil it could avoid consuming annually in 2050, compared with 2022? And how much more electricity it need to charge all vehicles in a year? Assumming the total vihecle numbers stays the same. (1.5pt)

## 2. UK coal phase out

### Background  

Please read the story of the [Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoreham_Nuclear_Power_Plant) and the [Diablo Canyon Power Plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_Canyon_Power_Plant). One plant never commerically operated and was decommisioned and the rate-payers are still paying the construction costs, while the other is offered to extend operation in the midist of California's clean energy quest.
